Power BI Project Report – Coffee Sales Analysis

Project Topic:
Analysis of coffee beverage purchasing trends and consumer behavior by time, coffee type, and payment method.
Data Source:
The data was obtained from Kaggle as two CSV files via this link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales?select=index_2.csv
I performed a Nested Join on the two files to create a single table (after removing an unnecessary column).
Initially, I had data covering sales from the beginning of 2024 to March 2025.
Since this was insufficient for building reliable forecasts, I used ChatGPT to generate an additional file covering data from 2021 through the end of 2023.
The project’s goal was to demonstrate my ability to analyze data in Power BI, so I allowed myself to supplement the data using AI (based on the original files) to complete the analysis more effectively.
After redesigning the tables, filtering out irrelevant columns, and merging them, I created a unified table named FactFullTable, which contains:
•	Purchase date
•	Coffee type
•	Purchase amount
•	Payment method (cash/card)

Data Preparation & Cleaning:
•	Data was imported using Power Query.
•	Anomalous / irrelevant values and columns were removed.
•	Column data types were defined correctly.
•	Duplicate issues were addressed at the CSV stage before import.

Data Model:
•	Dimensional tables were created: DimCalendar, DimPayment, DimCoffee.
•	The fact table of FactFullTable was already in place.
•	A Star Schema was built.
(Note: The original raw files – index_1, index_2, and the AI-generated file – were kept outside the model)
•	Relationships were defined as one-to-many between Dim to Fact tables.
•	Hierarchies were created: Year > Quarter > Month > Day, used in visualizations.

Key Measures (DAX):
•	Total Revenue
•	Average Orders per Day
•	Top Selling Coffee
•	Total Cash Sales
•	Total Card Sales
•	Amount of Orders

Report Structure – Four Main Pages:
1.	General Overview
2.	Time Based Analysis
3.	Coffee Name Based Analysis
4.	Payment-Type Based Analysis
5.	Forecasts


Each page includes:
•	Data cards showing summary metrics for selected time frames.
•	Charts showing sales by coffee type and by quarter/month.
•	Slicers to filter by coffee type, payment method, and time (year, quarter, month, week, day).
•	Drill-down via time hierarchy.
•	The Forecast page includes 2-year projections based on the last 5 years of data, broken down by year, quarter, and month.

Business questions that can be answered by the dashboard:
•	What is the top-selling coffee in a selected time frame? (Measure: Top Selling Coffee)
•	Which payment method is more dominant at a given time frame – cash or card? (Measure: Total Cash Sales, Total Card Sales)
•	How do sales trends change over time? Comparison of sales across years, months and days.
•	What is the average number of orders per day? (Measure: Average Orders per Day)
•	How many orders were made - broken down by time, coffee type, and payment method?
•	Sales forecasts for 2026 and 2027.
